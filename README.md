# Cyber Case Resolution Portal 🚨🕵️‍♂️

**Bridging the communication gap between citizens and cyber cell officials for faster, more transparent case resolution.**

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

In today's digital age, cyber crime is a growing concern, and its victims often face daunting challenges. While financial accounts can be frozen swiftly to prevent further loss, the subsequent investigation process frequently leaves affected citizens in a state of uncertainty and isolation. They struggle to get timely updates, understand the next steps, or communicate effectively with the assigned investigating officer. This lack of a clear, integrated communication channel leads to prolonged delays and immense stress, hindering the rapid resolution of cases.

This project aims to revolutionize this process by creating a streamlined, transparent, and efficient two-part system. It empowers citizens with real-time case information and provides cyber cell officers with robust tools to manage investigations, fostering a more accountable and user-centric approach to resolving cyber crime.

## 💡 The Problem We're Solving

The existing system often creates a significant communication void, leading to:
* **Information Blackouts:** Citizens are left without updates on their case status.
* **Inefficient Communication:** Difficulty in connecting with the investigating officer.
* **Delayed Evidence Submission:** Cumbersome processes for submitting crucial documents and proofs.

These challenges not only add to the victim's distress but also impede the cyber cell's ability to collect and process vital information quickly, which is critical in time-sensitive cyber crime investigations.

## ✨ Key Features (Current & Planned)

### 📲 Citizen Android App
* **Instant Case Status Lookup:** Citizens can easily retrieve the latest status and core details of their cyber crime case using a unique, official case ID.
* **Comprehensive Case Dashboard:** A centralized view displaying all vital case-related information, including the investigating officer's contact details, specifics of the disputed transaction, and the date their account was placed on hold.
* **Secure Evidence Submission:** A intuitive, multi-section form guiding citizens through the process of uploading personal details, identification documents, detailed transaction explanations, and critical financial proofs like bank statements directly to their case file.
* **[Planned] Video KYC Scheduling:** Future implementation will allow citizens to conveniently schedule and attend secure video calls for identity verification with their assigned officer.
* **[Planned] Real-time Notifications:** Automated alerts for significant case updates, scheduled video call reminders, and direct communications from the investigating officer.

### 🌐 Officer Web Portal
* **Secure Officer Authentication:** A robust login and sign-up system exclusively for officers, featuring domain-restricted email registration (e.g., `@cybercell.gov.in`) to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive case information.
* **Evidence Review Dashboard:** A central, intuitive hub providing officers with a comprehensive view of all evidence submissions from citizens, directly linked to their respective cases. Officers can easily review uploaded documents and associated details.
* **[Planned] Case Management:** Tools to effectively create new cyber crime cases, assign them to specific officers, update case statuses (e.g., 'Under Investigation', 'Resolved'), and manage investigation timelines.
* **[Planned] Video KYC Management:** Features to view all scheduled video verification calls, initiate secure video calls with citizens, and conduct remote identity verification.
* **[Planned] Officer Profiles & Administration:** Functionality to manage officer details, roles, and case assignments within the department.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Citizen Android App:** Java, Android SDK, XML for UI Layouts.
* **Officer Web Portal:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
* **Backend & Database:** Google Firebase (Firestore for flexible NoSQL database, Authentication for secure user management, Storage for robust file uploads).
